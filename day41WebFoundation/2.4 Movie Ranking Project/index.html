<h1>The Best Movies According to Erick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>“Transformers: Dark of the Moon”</h3>
<p>
“Transformers: Dark of the Moon” is the third installment in the Transformers franchise. The film is a visual spectacle, boasting some of the best animation and CGI in the industry1. The 3D viewing experience is particularly noteworthy, making it worth your money1.

The plot is more substantial compared to its predecessor2. It reveals that mankind’s first mission to the moon was intended to investigate an alien spacecraft that crashed on the dark side2. This ship, “the Arc,” carried the robots to this solar system from their own, so that the good bots could continue their struggle for “freedom” against the bad bots2.

However, the film has been criticized for its loud and long battle scenes, which some viewers found tiring23. The final hour of the movie involves a battle for the universe, which takes place in Chicago2. This battle is protracted mercilessly beyond all reason, at an ear-shattering sound level2.

The human characters, including Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), are somewhat overshadowed by the battling robots2. Their roles are mostly to provide a human perspective to the conflict2.

<h3>“Titanic”</h3>
<p>
“Titanic,” directed by James Cameron, is an epic romance set against the backdrop of the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic1. The film is a blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama2, and it’s considered a mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron2.

The film tells the story of Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a young woman sailing to America to marry a rich snob, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane)3. She meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a brash kid from steerage, and they fall in love3. Their romance is beautifully portrayed, with award-worthy performances that turned the lead actors into bona fide movie stars1.

The film is also a technical marvel. The shots of the Titanic are convincing and seamless, making you believe you’re looking at a real ship3. The sinking of the ship is reenacted with terrifying realism, giving viewers a sense of the ship’s terrible death throes3.

However, the film has been criticized for its long runtime and the melodramatic nature of the plot2. Some viewers found the love story to be clichéd4. Despite these criticisms, “Titanic” remains an epic achievement in filmmaking4.

In conclusion, “Titanic” is a visually stunning, emotionally engaging film that has stood the test of time1. It’s a testament to the power of storytelling and the magic of cinema

<h3>“We Were Soldiers”</h3>
<p>
    “We Were Soldiers” is a war film that depicts the first major land battle in the Vietnam War12. Directed by Randall Wallace, the movie is based on the best-selling book “We Were Soldiers Once … and Young” by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and journalist Joseph L. Galloway3.

    The film stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, a family man and a Harvard graduate who studies international relations1. Sam Elliott plays Sgt. Maj. Plumley, an Army lifer who is hard, brave, and unsentimental1. Their performances are commendable, bringing to life the characters’ bravery and leadership1.
    
    The movie is praised for its brutal and realistic depiction of the engagement between 400 American and 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers in the Ia Drang Valley in November 19652. The combat scenes are intense and unyielding, covering a significant portion of the movie, making it a stupendous achievement in modern filmmaking2.
    
    However, the film has been criticized for laying the war cliches a bit thick3. Some viewers found that the movie lacks a clear point of view other than portraying soldiers as heroes and war as a necessary enterprise to maintain democracy4.
    
    Despite these criticisms, “We Were Soldiers” is a moving portrayal of a war that is still full of controversy over how it was handled5. It paints a very moral picture, showing the great sadness, then anguish, fear, and suspense as the direction progresses smoothly between scenes5.
    
    In conclusion, “We Were Soldiers” is a well-crafted war film that succeeds at putting a human face on soldiers of both sides in the Vietnam War. It’s a film about uncommon valor and nobility under fire, loyalty among soldiers, and the heroism and sacrifice of men and women both home and abroad.
